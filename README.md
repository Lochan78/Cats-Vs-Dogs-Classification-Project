# Cats-Vs-Dogs-Classification-Project
**Overview**
This project aims to classify images as either dogs or cats using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset consisting of labeled images of dogs and cats to train and evaluate the model.

**Project Structure**
Dataset: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
Code: Contains the source code for the classification model.
Model: Includes the trained model files or information on how to obtain the model.
Evaluation: Details on how the model was evaluated and its performance metrics.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
Libraries:
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
etc.

**Usage**
Dataset Preparation: Download the dataset and place it in the specified folder.
Training: Run the training script to train the model on the dataset.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model using the provided evaluation script or notebook.
Prediction: Use the trained model to classify new images as dogs or cats.

**Model Performance**
Accuracy: Achieved an approximate accuracy of 80.80% on the validation set.
